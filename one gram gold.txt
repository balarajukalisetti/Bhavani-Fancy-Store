1 GRAM GOLD
One gram gold jewelry is another name given for gold-plated jewelry. 
This jewelry comes with a coating of one gram gold on it, which makes it look similar to real 22-karat jewelry. 
So what makes people interested in buying one gram gold ornaments? Of course, affordability is an important factor in favor of one gram gold. 
Gold lovers who cannot financially afford pure gold can opt for this type of jewelry. 
One gram gold jewelry is available in a variety of traditional and modern designs. 
Jewelry makers are offering a wide range of options, including models that cannot be made in pure gold. 
Also, various gems and stones can also be embedded in them, and this is more comfortable than 22-karat jewelry because 1 gram gold is harder and stronger. 
It also avoids the financial risks in cases of theft or loss.
